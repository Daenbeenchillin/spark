# Fees + economy

The Spark protocol was designed with a battle-tested fee model to foster a mutually advantageous environment for all participants, including Defi developers, institutional and retail traders.

The fee structure encourages the creation of order book-based protocols using the Spark infrastructure tools, encouraging token staking and providing competitive trading fees.



### Fee Distribution:&#x20;

When a CLOB-based DEX is built using the Spark Platform, the trading fees are allocated between the Spark protocol treasury and the DEX. This distribution is as follows:

50% of the trading fees contribute to the spark protocol treasury ensuring ongoing funding for the platform's future developments and enhancements.

50% of the trading fees areas are allocated to the DEX, fostering growth and motivating developers to create and maintain their decentralized exchange built using the spark infrastructure.&#x20;

Spark only charges takers, introducing 0 fees for the makers. We're sure that protocols launching ontop of Spark will introduce their own maker fees.&#x20;
