# Introduction

Spark is a fully **on-chain central limit order book** (CLOB) that provides exceptional control to liquidity providers and is designed to be agnostic to any particular asset. It is built on [Fuel network](https://fuel.network/). When integrated into protocols, Spark provides the advantages of **consolidated** **liquidity** and top-of-the-line **trading infrastructure**. Additionally, market makers benefit from the increased trading volume that results from this consolidated liquidity.\
\
Spark provides a comprehensive suite of DeFi infrastructure tools designed to form a predicate-driven, fully on-chain central limit order book, matching engine, API set, and SDKs operating on the [Fuel.network. ](http://fuel.network/)With a focus on scalability and seamless integration, Spark enables protocols to access a decentralized liquidity hub, fostering capital efficiency and deep liquidity throughout the ecosystem.

Spark operates using an order book model, allowing users to trade various cryptocurrencies in a secure and transparent manner and enabling peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies with high transaction throughput and low fees.
