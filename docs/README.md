## What is Spark?

Spark V1 is a cross-margin oracle-based perpetual order book built on [Fuel Network](https://www.fuel.network/). V1 design is made for optimum user experience and safety, as well as to give us a launchpad for future innovations.&#x20;

Spark V1 will rely on the active participation of market-makers for its success, and future iterations of our protocol will include various mechanisms to enhance the user trading experience.



Key features of **Spark V1**:

* A highly performant order book for longing/shorting Perpetual Contracts with up to 2000 TPS
* Cross-margin, partial liquidations, and funding rates
* An advanced risk engine and insurance fund will ensure that the protocol incurs no bad debt
* SDKs and APIs for non-custodial interaction with our order book
* Users will be able to gain up to 50x leverage (depending on how much margin they have)

Spark V1 solely accepts USDC as collateral and requires active market makers in order to reduce spread.

This means that on Mainnet, we will foster active participation from market makers. Read more in our Market Makers incentivization program.
