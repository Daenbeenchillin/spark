The next step is to acquire some funds in your wallet. To mint tokens on the Fuel network, you'll need to have some ETH in your wallet to pay transaction fees. There are two ways to obtain ETH:

1. The first is through the main [faucet link](https://faucet-beta-3.fuel.network).
2. The second is by visiting the [Faucet](https://app.allspark.gg/#/faucet) page on our app, which features a table with all tokens supported by our platform, including UNI, USDC, BTC, LINK and any other in near future. Note that to mint any token other than ETH, you must first have some ETH in your wallet.
