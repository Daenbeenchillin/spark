# ⛽ Why Fuel

**Unmatched efficiency with Sway:** Fuel’s Sway language overcomes the limitation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling atomic parallel execution and efficient memory management through predicates, which are essential for the fast-paced execution environment required for algorithmic trading.

**Decentralization without compromise:** Fuel strikes an ideal balance between performance and decentralization, ensuring price efficiency and adhering to the core principles of DeFi. Its modular and multi-chain design allows for seamless integration with other networks further enhancing decentralization.&#x20;

**Enhanced security and liquidity:** Fuel maintains the security and liquidity offered by Ethereum while offering native account abstraction for increased privacy. Its UTXO model allows algorithmic traders to have access to a safe and liquid environment for executing novel strategies, avoiding issues faced by some Appchains and alternative CLOBs.&#x20;

**Robust CLOB implementation:** Fuel architecture supports the creation of an efficient central limit order book (CLOB) on its virtual machine (VM), providing traders with superior capital efficiency, minimal friction cost, and faster trade execution compared to EVM-base Layer 1 or 2 solutions.\
\
**Market volatility resilience:** Fuel’s design ensures reliable gas estimation even during periods of high market volatility, minimizing trading fees and delays. This is essential for professional traders who require performance in all market conditions.
