# âš¡ Fuel Wallet

To interact with the Spark, you'll first need to connect a wallet. There are three options for doing this:

1. Generate a new account by clicking the "Connect to Wallet" button and then clicking the "Create account" button in the modal window that appears. After generating the account, you can copy the seed phrase for safekeeping by clicking the "Copy Seed" button.
2. Connect a Fuel Wallet, which is currently in alpha testing. For more information on how to do this, please follow this link: [https://wallet.fuel.network/](https://wallet.fuel.network/).
