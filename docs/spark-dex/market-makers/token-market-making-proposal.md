# Token Market Making Proposal

_Loan Amount: $5 million_

_Term: 1 year_

_Call Option Strike Price: VWAP - maker\_market\_share_

**Amount: $5 million**

* Return of $5 million or USD 10 million (Strike = 2x Market price at inception; 7-day average is acceptable) after one year.
* Potential for a Strike improvement by 2x market share but not exceeding 25% share, i.e., lowest Strike = 1.5x Market at inception.
* Targeted exchanges: Binance, Okx, Bybit, Kucoin, Kraken, Coinbase

**Maker Market Share**

* The critical component is the maker\_market\_share, representing the percentage of USDs spot volume traded passively (maker) by the Market Maker during the 1-year Term compared to the volume traded on the five exchanges.
* The Market Maker is incentivized to maximize maker\_market\_share by quoting tightly, maintaining narrow bid-ask spreads, and executing large order sizes.

**Call Option Details**

* Expiry date at the end of the 1-year contract Term.
* Strike price is VWAP7 - maker\_market\_share.
* VWAP7 is the volume-weighted average price of all USD spot trades on Binance in the first 7 days of the Term.
* Example: If VWAP7 = 1.3 and maker\_market\_share = 10.520%, the strike price would be 1.16324.
* The Market Maker returns $5 million or $5,816,200 USD (or stable coin equivalent).
* Higher maker\_market\_share compensates for potential trading losses, driving the Market Maker toward the optimum maker\_market\_share that maximizes the call option upside.

**Reporting**

* The Market Maker commits to providing regular reports encompassing all relevant metrics, with the frequency and content determined collaboratively.
* Reports will include maker\_market\_share based on front-office numbers reconciled with exchange-provided data.
* Periodic requests for maker\_market\_share will be made directly to the exchanges, ideally sent directly to \[Your Team/Project Contact]. Alternatively, exchange-generated reports will be forwarded accordingly.
