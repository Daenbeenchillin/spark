# Spark Points Earning Program

**Description**

**Sprk Points Earning Program Introduction:** The Sprk Points program is designed to reward liquidity providers and traders on the Sprk.fi protocol. Participants earn Sprk Points based on their contributions to the order book, promoting liquidity, and actively engaging in trades. These points can be redeemed for various benefits within the Sprk.fi ecosystem.

#### **Liquidity Provision Program:**

**Formula:**

```makefile
makefileCopy code
LP_Spark_Points = (Liquidity_USDC * Days * LP_Weight) / X
```

**Example:** Suppose a user provides $X in USDC liquidity for 30 days with an LP\_Weight of Y. The Spark Points calculation would be:

```bash
bashCopy code
LP_Spark_Points = ($X * Y * Z) / N = X Spark Points
```

#### **Trading Program:**

**Formula:**

```makefile
makefileCopy code
Trader_Spark_Points = (Trading_Volume * Trades * Trader_Weight) / 1000
```

**Example:** If a trader executes $X in trading volume with a frequency of 20 trades and a Trader\_Weight of Y, the Spark Points calculation would be:

```bash
bashCopy code
Trader_Spark_Points = ($X * Y * N) / 1000 = X Spark Points
```

#### **Market Program:**

**Formula:**

```makefile
makefileCopy code
Market_Spark_Points = (Total_Liquidity * Market_Weight) / 1000
```

**Example:** Suppose the total liquidity across supported pairs reaches $X with a Market\_Weight of N. The Spark Points calculation for the Market Program would be:

```bash
bashCopy code
Market_Spark_Points = ($X * N) / 1000 = X Spark Points
```

**Program Description:**

In addition to liquidity provision and trading, the Spark Points Earning Program introduces a Market Program to incentivize overall market health. Users earn Spark Points based on the total liquidity across supported pairs, encouraging the growth and stability of the ecosystem.

**Market Program:**

* Users earn Spark Points based on the total liquidity in the market.
* Market\_Weight determines the weight assigned to the overall market health, influencing Spark Points earnings.

**Conversion to Spark and Fuel Tokens:**

* Users can convert Spark Points to Spark Tokens at a some ratio.
* 1 Spark Point = X Spark Token.
* Users can further convert Spark Tokens to Fuel Tokens at a rate of X Spark Tokens for 1 Fuel Token.

These conversion mechanisms provide flexibility and additional benefits for users within the ecosystem.
